# Project: Acebook

For this project you will be working in teams to produce a social media platform.

Each team will start a virtual card-wall with some initial tickets to get you started.

### Assessment Criteria

These [assessment criteria](../assessment_criteria.md) will be how we look at your work

### Your First Steps on the C# pathway

If C# is new to your team, you'll need to spend the first week learning the basics.  Make your own copy of [this trello board](https://trello.com/b/EjkmVb5N/learn-c-sharp-and-dotnet) and use it to guide you.

You can then assess yourselves using the [learning triangle](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/blooms_taxonomy.md).

## Project Set Up

Follow [these instructions](../project_setup.md) to get your team set up and ready to work.

## Demo app

[This simple app](https://github.com/makersacademy/TodoApi) is an example of a simple C# JSON API.  Clone it and figure out how it works.

[This AcebookApi](https://github.com/makersacademy/acebook-csharp-template) was developed by refactoring the TodoApi.  Try comparing the two.

**Do not work on this until everyone in your team is comfortable with basic programming in C#.**

## Card Wall

[Make your own copy of this template](https://trello.com/b/Dgcyzjcp/acebook-csharp-template) or [choose another option](../project_setup.md#card-wall).
