# Time Management Tools

Learning how to properly manage your time is one small change you can make while at Makers that can dramatically improve your experience and pace of learning.

This pill documents three different techniques for managing your time effectively.

## 📦 Time-boxing

Best to use if you're concerned about spending time on the wrong thing, or tend to fall down rabbit holes!

1. Decide what you want to work on

2. Set a timer for 30 minutes or less
3. Work until the timer goes off

When the timer goes off you can either:

- Reset the timer and continue working on the same thing, or
- Reset the timer and work on something else, or
- Take a break

## 🍅 Pomodoro Technique

Best to use if you struggle to maintain focus on a single task, and have lots of different things you could be doing.

1. Make a list of all the tasks you want to complete

2. Decide which task you are going to tackle first
3. Set a timer for 25 minutes and work on this task until you have finished the task, or the timer goes off.
4. Take a 5 minute break - you have completed one pomodoro

Repeat this cycle 4-5 times, then take a longer break (at least 30 minutes)
