FIRE SAFETY
------

* Neither smoking, nor "vaping", is permitted anywhere within the building.

* Don’t overload power lines. Do not use or bring to the office faulty electrical equipment. Report any faults to a member of staff.

* Keep fire exits closed at all times.

In the event of a fire:

* Follow the fire exit signs to vacate the building.

* Don't stop to collect personal belongings.

* Follow the instructions of the Fire Marshals (Edward, Dana, Camelia, Becks, Emily, Anna, Alice, Nikesh) to leave the building, fire exit signs and do not use lifts.

* Assembly point is in the corner of Thrawl Street and Commercial Street - turn right out of the front door.

FIRST AID
--------

* If somebody gets injured, get help from one of the first aiders - Dana or Nikesh.

* There are first aid boxes on the 3rd floor.

If you have any questions related to fire safety, first aid, or general health & safety, please direct them to our health & safety officers Jess or Chloe.
