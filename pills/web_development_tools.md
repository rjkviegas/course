# Web Development Tools

When building web applications from scratch you often need some extra resources to assist your development process, or quickly improve the look and feel of your new application.

The tools in this pill will be useful in almost every web development project, and will help you to build attractive apps with minimal effort.

## Wireframe Tools

Before starting to build your application, it's a great idea to draw simple illustrations of the user journey (wireframes). Wireframes typically show basic layout of each page in an application, including user interaction points like buttons and input fields. They can be linked together to show the overall user journey.

- [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) allows one free project for drawing wireframes.
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) has a 30 day free trial of the cloud version.

## Exploring APIs

When working with APIs, it can be useful to interrogate them to check what various queries return. This can be useful both when building an API, and also when building an app that will consume an API.

- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) has a user-friendly interface and it's easy to set up your queries with the correct headers.
- [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) is a command line tool that can be used to make requests without needing to use a user interface.

## Dummy Data

If you need to use fake email or web addresses for development and test, don't just make up domain names or even worse use the very real `test.com` domain!

There is a domain reserved especially for this purpose: [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com)

You can create as many `@example.com` email addresses as you like, safe in the knowledge that you won't ever accidentally spam someone!

## Accessibility Tools

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) is a great tool for checking how accessible your web app is.

## Web Design & Content
At Makers your focus should always be on adding functionality to your applications, but these resources are useful if you want to tidy up a project ready for presentation.

### Images
It's sometimes useful to have some basic images in your application to show how it looks with images included. There are plenty of good resources for free images, here are a couple to get you started:

- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/royalty-free-images/)

### Icons
Icons are an easy way to add some character to your site, and can make it easier to navigate.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is a free vector icon library.
- [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/) Has over 2 million free icons.

### Fonts
Another easy way to inject some personality into your project is to switch up the font. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is one of the most comprehensive free font libraries.

### Lorem Ipsum
Need some dummy text to show how a web page will look with content? Use [Lorem Ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/) - this generator allows you to specify how much text you need.

### Component Libraries
You can use component libraries to improve the look and feel of static sites, or even integrate the CSS library into larger projects.
Two good options are given below:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/)

#### Components for popular front end libraries
Material UI is a popular tool for building modern web applications - you can utilise pre-built HTML components to instantly improve the look and feel of your site. Below are two component libraries specifically for React and Vue.

- [Material UI for React](https://material-ui.com/)
- [VueMaterial](https://vuematerial.io/)

## Conclusion
There are always new tools and libraries being developed to help web developers build great apps. The above resources are a small selection, and should not be considered a definitive list!
