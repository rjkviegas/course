# Project: Birthday greeter web app

To achieve these goals:
  > "I use a methodical approach to solving problems"
  > "I test-drive my code"
  > "I create effective documentation"
  > "I can design and build user interfaces"
  > "I can deploy web applications"
  > "I can design a system"
  > "I have a methodical approach to solving problems"
  > "I can debug anything"
  > "I can TDD anything"
  > "I know how the web works"
  > "I can build web apps"
  > "I can build with objects"
  > "I can test-drive my code"

## Action Plan
In order to test my understanding of web apps and verify that I can build a simple web app with a form using an MVC framework, I will build a birthday greeter app.

## Evidence Plan
- Can you explain how the information flows between the browser and your website?
  - Which HTTP requests are sent by the browser?
  - What are the HTTP responses from the server?
  - Did you test drive the whole thing?
  - Do you have feature tests?
- Ask these questions of your code — the answers should all be yes:
  - Do the tests pass?
  - If you break the code, do the tests fail?
  - Is the code straightforward and easy to read? Does someone who isn't me think so?
  - Is the code well designed? (e.g. broken into multiple files, each with a single responsibility)
- What does a coach think of it?
