# Project: TDD Cycle Decision Tree

To achieve these goals:
  > "I test-drive my code"
  > "I can model anything"
  > "I can TDD anything"
  > "I can test-drive my code"

## Action Plan

Build a decision tree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) for the TDD Cycle.

It should accept a User Story as an input. It should output a Feature.

It should include the following levels:

  - Feature Test
  - Unit Test
  - Implementation

It should include Refactoring.

## Evidence Plan
  - Try the decision tree out live. Does it work? Do you end up systematically following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle?
  - Give it to someone else. When they follow it without interpreting it too much, do they end up doing the TDD Cycle?
  - Show and explain your decision tree to a coach. Do they agree it's accurate?
