This is what we mean by success at Makers. It runs through everything we do.

Your success here is determined by a precise but challenging question — are you achieving your goals? This requires you to not only understand your goals and work towards them, but also put time and effort into understanding your progress towards them.

Makers is designed to prepare you for success in the world, and the world works the same way. From the smallest garage start-up to the most successful multinational, from community enterprises to the world's most impactful charities — throughout history people have used goals to help them bring about the world they wanted to live in.

The goal-related skills you develop here will help you take control of your career and your life. The technical skills you learn will give you the most powerful tools that presently exist for achieving those goals.

We're excited to see what success means for you.

## What are your goals?

Since you're at Makers doing a software development course, we assume that you would like to become a great software developer.  If that's not the case, we should talk about that! :)

At the end of your apprenticeship, you'll be assessed against the [18 standard points](https://airtable.com/shrTRRuegEe7fQ49t), so your initial goals should take you towards covering those.  Whilst on the bootcamp, that means you'll be acquiring the skills and behaviours that the standards describe.

## When will you work towards them?

See the [daily schedule](daily_schedule.md)

## What are your responsibilities?
Education at Makers Academy is designed to be empowering. Being a software engineer means looking at any problem you encounter and believing "With thoughtful effort, I can solve this."

We trust you with three responsibilities:

* Deciding what to aim for (your goals).
* Determining how to get there (your plan).
* Getting insight into your progress (self-assessment).

We believe that you are the best person to lead these things. This way, when someone asks you how it's going, you should know pretty accurately how you're doing as a software engineer, where you want to get to, and how you're going to get there.

You will know when to put in more effort, when to slow down, change focus, employ your strengths or strengthen your weaknesses. You will know when you are ready to apply for jobs. You're in the driving seat.

### Some resource to help you gain insight into your progress

* [Tracking your learning](./self_directed_learning/resources/tracking_your_learning.md)
* [Assessing the strength of your evidence](./self_directed_learning/resources/strength_of_evidence.md)
* [Some advice from people who have done this before](./self_directed_learning/resources/peer_advice_to_new_learners.md)

## What are coaches' responsibilities?
So what's our job?

* To support you with the above.
* To provide an environment with the tools and motivation necessary to achieve your goals.

Not everyone will come here knowing how to take control of their own journey — and that's fine. It's our job to give you the prompts and starting-points to train the habits of planning and self-assessment.

And then there's the matter of making the environment here as rich in opportunities to learn as possible. If you're not sure whether your code is readable or not, it should be easy to learn how to determine that, execute it, and then engage productively with the task of improving your code. Moreover, the atmosphere and people around you should inspire you to be better.
